# Breakdown of stuff that needs to be done
- Create basic UI.
- Create event listener for mouse click.
- Create function that adds an object (e.g. circle).
- Connect the two functions, so it adds a circle when clicked.
- Do it again, for another object type and comment out the previous.
  Do this until you have a basic, if unconfigurable, implementation of
  all object types that need to be added.
- Expand and adjust after that.
