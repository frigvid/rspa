# RSPA
RSPA is a simple JavaFX painting application. Complete with bad UX to boot!

For your own sanity, don't use it.

## Features
- Drawing with a mouse (great!).
- Drawing with a mouse (bad!).
- Create 4 different shapes:
  - Circle.
  - Line.
  - Rectangle.
  - Text.
- Changing mouse cursor relative to actions, most of the time (neat!).
- Move shapes around by holding Alt and dragging them.
- Delete shapes (wow!).
- Reset the "canvas."
- Change properties of shapes:
  - Shared - (color, opacity).
  - Circle - (radius).
  - Line - (length, thickness).
  - Rectangle - (width, height).
  - Text - (text, font size).
- Amazingly bad UX (cool!).
